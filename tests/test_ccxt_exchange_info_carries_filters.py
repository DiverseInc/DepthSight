"""fetch_exchange_info() and get_symbol_info() MUST return the same shape.

The controller's `_update_market_info_cache` builds `_market_info_cache` by
parsing `symbol_data["filters"]` for `filterType == "PRICE_FILTER"` /
`tickSize`. That is the ONLY source of `tick_size` for breakeven and partial-TP
rounding.

`get_symbol_info()` emitted Binance-shaped `filters`, but the bulk
`fetch_exchange_info()` builder emitted a stripped entry with no `filters` key
at all -- while `exchanges/base.py` states the protocol is "deliberately
compatible with the existing BinanceExecutor return shapes". So on every CCXT
exchange (this deployment is OKX) `tick_size` was always None, and the only
symptom was a per-candle WARNING:

    [PositionMgmt:BTCUSDT] Could not get tick_size for BTCUSDT.
    Breakeven logic may not work!

These tests drive the REAL methods and assert the shape contract.
