# File: tests/test_ml_confirmation_fail_open_is_not_silent.py
"""
A strategy that asks for ML confirmation must never look like it got one when
the model never ran.

THE DEFECT
----------
`_process_signal` evaluates live ML confirmation in two nested blocks:

    ml_confirmed_this_signal_live = True            # <- initialised optimistic
    if use_ml_confirmation_flag:                    # strategy asked for it
        if (runtime_enabled and extractor and pipeline):
            ...                                     # model actually runs
        else:
            logger.debug("... not enabled or components not ready. Skipping.")

The outer `else` was a DEBUG line, and it fell through leaving
`ml_confirmed_this_signal_live` at its initialised `True`. Two consequences:

  1. **Silent.** Every other fail-open in that same block is a WARNING that
     literally says "Allowing signal (fail-open)" -- missing klines, None from
     predict_proba_one, failed feature extraction, failed normalisation. This
     was the single fail-open that announced nothing, and at the deployed INFO
     level it was invisible.
  2. **A false audit record.** `signal.details["ml_confirmed_live"]` was
     stamped `True`, so the trade log affirmatively recorded that the model had
     approved a signal it never evaluated. A strategy configured with
     `use_ml_confirmation: true` was trading as though a risk control was
     gating it when nothing was checking anything.

This is NOT the same event as the sibling fail-opens. Those are "the model ran
and could not reach a verdict on this candle" -- transient. This one is "the
model never loaded at all" -- structural, and it persists for the life of the
process.

LIVE EVIDENCE (2026-10-07, deployment of 5d41335)
-------------------------------------------------
Every one of the 12 paper controllers logged at ERROR:

    [MLConfirmLive] Failed to load Live ML Confirmation model from
    data/offline_trained_model.joblib. Live ML Confirmation will be SKIPPED.

while `ML_CONFIRMATION_ENABLED` was true. Every controller therefore sat in the
exact state this test covers, permanently.

WHY THIS TEST SHAPE
-------------------
It calls the REAL `_process_signal` -- no copy of the branch under test -- on a
real `TradingController` with a real registered strategy instance, and asserts
on observable state: the WARNING actually emitted, and the `signal.details`
the trade log is built from. The signal is driven only as far as the end of the
ML block; `_get_market_info` is stubbed to raise a sentinel purely as a
ramp-stop, because everything this test claims has already happened by then.
